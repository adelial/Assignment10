The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll. The scores are based on answers 
to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll. This question, known as the Cantril ladder, 
asks respondents to think of a ladder with the best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst possible 
life being a 0 and to rate their own current lives on that scale. The scores are from nationally representative 
samples for the years 2013-2016 and use the Gallup weights to make the estimates representative.
