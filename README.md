/* The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll. The scores are based on answers 
 * to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll. This question, known as the Cantril ladder, 
 * asks respondents to think of a ladder with the best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst possible 
 * life being a 0 and to rate their own current lives on that scale. The scores are from nationally representative 
 * samples for the years 2013-2016 and use the Gallup weights to make the estimates representative.
